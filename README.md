In this project we've pulled data from New York city government's tracking on sales of homes (http://www1.nyc.gov/home/search/index.page?search-terms=Rolling+sales+update) for Staten Island.

We used this data in an attempt to determine if there is a relationship between the square footage of a house and its selling price on the market.
